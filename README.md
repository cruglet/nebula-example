# Nebula Example Module

This repository is an example/template module for **Nebula**, designed to demonstrate how a module should be structured and integrated with Nebula. It serves as a template for creating new modules, providing code and example implementations with the preferred practices for the engine.

> **Note:** This module is typically cloned **within the base Nebula repository**, under the following path:  
> `repo_root/client/modules/example/`

## "Why a separate repo?"
Modules are maintained in their own repositories for three main reasons: to keep version control easy and separate, to prototype easily, and to encourage consistent standards.

## Additional Notes
- This repository is intentionally simple and focused on clarity rather than completeness.
